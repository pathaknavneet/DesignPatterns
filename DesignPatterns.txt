Design Patterns are broadly divided into 3 categories.
1. 	Creational 
2.	Structural
3. 	Behavioral

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Creational Design Patterns : 
 
Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms and are used in situations when basic form of object creation could result in design problems or increase complexity of a code base. 

Type of Creational Design Patterns:

1. Singleton
2. Factory 
3. Abstract factory
4. Prototype
5. Builder 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Behavioral Design Patterns :

Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

Type of Behavioral Design Pattern :

1. Command
2. Observer
3. Mediator
4. Strategy 
5. Visitor 
6. Iterator 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structural Design Patterns :

Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

Type of Structural Design Pattern:

1. Adapter
2. Bridge : Decouple the abstraction from its implementation so that they 2 can evolve independently in the future .
3. Decorator
4. Composite
5. Facade
6. Proxy
